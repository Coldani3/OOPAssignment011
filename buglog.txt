---inventory sometimes crashes with index out of range error--- - FIXED
reproducible with:
scroll to bottom of inventory so that Go to Main Menu is visible
scroll up to the Steak 5 above it 



steak is index 5 (6th item in inventory)
only seems to crash when the final option is visible

does not happen with the ball which is right above to main menu, does happen with the steak above
- related to the removal of the item?
- it seems to remove the right item
- possibly to do with the menu rejigging itself after the removal of the item and vertical offset not adjusting appropriately?

---control arrow on screens with a scroll will scroll to the top one on the page without updating the view---

---inventoryitem.getitembytype doesn't seem to work--- - FIXED... somehow?

---Main menu really laggy in VSCode console for some reason?---
Only happened after change room was added
Not anything to do with the change room menu specifically, a duplicate of an existing menu causes the same thing
